# Product Management App

This project is a **React-Redux** application that manages a collection of products, integrated with **Material-UI (MUI)** for user interface components. It allows users to search, filter, and paginate the list of products. The app fetches product data from an external API and displays it using a clean, responsive design powered by MUI.

## Features

- **Search**: Filter products by their title using a search bar.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter products based on their category.
- **Pagination**: Display products in pages, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of products.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For consistent and responsive UI components like buttons, forms, and layouts.
- **API Integration**: Fetch products from an external API using Redux `createAsyncThunk`.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management and handling asynchronous logic with `createAsyncThunk`.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For pre-built, customizable UI components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.
